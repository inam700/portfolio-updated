Hello LinkedIn! I'm excited to share that my developer portfolio is live! 🎉

Check it out here: [link](https://inamullah.com/)

This site brings together a collection of projects I’ve worked on over the years. It is a true labor of love, combining thoughtful design, and clean architecture into one focused space. Revisiting each piece was a reminder of how deeply design, structure, and problem-solving have shaped my journey.

🛠️ Built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer-Motion, and ShadCN — focused on performance, modularity, clean UI/UX, and real client work.

Whether you’re looking for a full-stack developer, want help building your own site, or just want to chat tech—I’d love to connect 🙌. Always open to feedback, collaborations, and new opportunities 🚀
